=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::PairAligner::DeleteTrivialAlignments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Runnable is only useful for self-alignments. In those cases, LastZ generates trivial alignments
(i.e. a region against itself) and we need to delete them in order to keep only the duplications.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
Internal methods are usually preceded with a _
